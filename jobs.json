    "job_description": "Company Description\n\nIntroduction\n\nSNV is a mission-driven global development partner working in more than 20 countries across Africa and Asia. Building on 60 years of experience and grounded in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we work on the core themes of gender equality and social inclusion, climate adaptation and mitigation, and strong institutions and effective governance. Our mission is to strengthen capacities and catalyse partnerships that transform the agri-food, energy, and water systems, which enable sustainable and more equitable lives for all. For more information, please refer to our website: www.snv.org\n\nProgramme Background\n\nSNV believes in rethinking, reforming, and enhancing institutional structures to lessen the impact of rapid urbanisation and climate threats. To do this, we must seek ways to improve the governance and practices of the waste management, drainage and water supply sectors. In Bangladesh, the local government is responsible for water, sanitation, drainage, and solid waste, often needing more local capacities. Private sector engagement plays a crucial role in making cities more sustainable, but accountability and performance still need improvement. SNV has been working with different stakeholders to set up PPPs with clearer rules of engagement and oversight to strengthen performance accountability by adopting a holistic approach to a sustainable urban sanitation service.\n\nIn Bangladesh, SNV had initiated urban water (primarily in Sanitation) programme from 2014 in southern cities and have been proactively engaged in National level to support urban sanitation initiatives. SNV initiated its Urban Sanitation Programme in Khulna City Corporation, Kushtia and Jhenaidah Paurashava with the support from BMGF. Based on the learning it stated a project titled \u2018WASH SDG\u2019 programme in Gazipur City Corporation, Jashore and Benapole Paurashava with support from DGIS to address service delivery challenges in sanitation and advance the sector development as a whole, through strategic engagement with Government Agencies and partnering with other experienced civil society and private sector organisations working in the sector.\n\nUsing an integrated approach, the WASH SDG programme strives to ensure that water and sanitation related facilities and services are sustainable, climate resilient, gender sensitive and socially inclusive. It is a multi-country intervention implemented in 20 cities in Nepal, Zambia, Tanzania, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Through this, SNV is willing to provide technical support focusing on Sanitation and Hygiene to city corporation/municipalities, which is implemented at Jashore Paurashava, Benapole Paurashava and Zone 1 and Zone 4 of Gazipur City Corporation. The WASH SDG programme is built on three core strategic objectives: (1) increasing demand for improved WASH facilities and practices; (2) improving the quality of service provision; and (3) improving governance of the sector.

As part of the treatment component, the sanitation business officer will contribute to the business models for treatment and re-use, as well as the integration of these models with oversight and governance arrangements. Across all SNV\u2019s work, gender and social inclusion is a priority. For example, the sanitation business officer is expected to integrate occupational health and safety of workers, inclusive services for all, gender equality in his/her work.\n\nIn addition to the role described above, the sanitation business officer is expected to contribute to the following aspects.\n\nThe programme focuses on building the capacity of local line agencies and other appropriate actors in urban sanitation.

    "job_description": "Company Description\n\nIntroduction\n\nSNV is a mission-driven global development partner working in more than 20 countries across Africa and Asia. Building on 60 years of experience and grounded in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we work on the core themes of gender equality and social inclusion, climate adaptation and mitigation, and strong institutions and effective governance. Our mission is to strengthen capacities and catalyse partnerships that transform the agri-food, energy, and water systems, which enable sustainable and more equitable lives for all. For more information, please refer to our website: www.snv.org\n\nProgramme Background\n\nIn Bangladesh, SNV had initiated urban water (primarily in sanitation) programme from 2014 in southern cities and have been proactively engaged in National level to support urban sanitation initiatives. SNV under the Urban Sanitation Programme with the support from BMGF and DGIS aims to support Local Authorities (Khulna and Gazipur City Corporations, Kushtia, Jhenaidah, Jessore and Benapole Paurashavas) to address service delivery challenges in sanitation and advance the sector development as a whole, through strategic engagement with Government Agencies and partnering with other experienced civil society and private sector organisations working in the sector.\n\nSNV believes in rethinking, reforming, and enhancing institutional structures to lessen the impact of rapid urbanisation and climate threats. To do this, we must seek ways to improve the governance and practices of the waste management, drainage and water supply sectors. In Bangladesh, the local government is responsible for water, sanitation, drainage, and solid waste, often needing more local capacities. Private sector engagement plays a crucial role in making cities more sustainable, but accountability and performance still need improvement. SNV has been working with different stakeholders to set up PPPs with clearer rules of engagement and oversight to strengthen performance accountability by adopting a holistic approach to a sustainable urban water cycle. In continuation of this, and in close collaboration with the two responsible national departments \u2013 the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) and the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) SNV is heading towards a new approach of promoting Sustainable Urban Water Cycle in Bangladesh. Supporting this, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Bangladesh has awarded SNV a new project in Bangladesh titled \"Transitioning to sustainable urban water cycles in Bangladesh (SUWC)\".\n\nThe objective of this project is to improve sanitation, solid waste, and drainage water management to protect the health and well-being of around 1.8 million people in 12 cities and towns by increasing access to safe, essential urban services (sanitation, solid waste, stormwater management). Moreover, the project will initiate improvements in relevant water resource management indicators at the city level over five years.\n\nThe project envisages following 6 (six) outcomes to support city-wide inclusive services by professionalisation and financial viability of urban sanitation and solid waste facilities.\n\nStrengthened capacities to support city-wide inclusive services.\nIncreased professionalisation and financial viability of urban sanitation and solid waste services.\nStrengthened governance, regulation, enforcement, and monitoring capacity.\nStrengthened performance, integration and circularity of treatment, reuse, and recycling.\nMore responsive strategic communication towards consumer behaviours.\nImproved capacity and preparedness for city-level floods and droughts.\n\nThe project works in various geographically and ecologically diverse areas across Bangladesh. Four city corporations and eight paurashavas \u2013 grouped into following six clusters. The cities are: Rajshahi, Sylhet, Cumilla and Khulna City Corporation, and Chapai Nawabganj, Shibganj, Bogura, Joypurhat, Lalmonirhat, Moulvibazar, Chatak, and Bagerhat municipality.\n\nThe project aligns with the long-term Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP) 2100; and related national commitments on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), most notably SDG 6 on achieving inclusive and sustainable safely managed sanitation, SDG11 around solid waste and water-related risks, and SDG13 around resilience, adaptive capacity and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nJob Description\n\nContext and purpose of the job\n\nThe project aims to achieve systems change towards a sustainable urban water cycle (SUWC) at the city level and contribute to the national level. We follow a systematic process through all interventions to ensure the approach is institutionalised within the LGIs e.g., City corporations, Paurashavas, strong coordination with WASA\u2019s, Development authorities, DC/UNO office etc.\n\nSNV is actively engaged at national level on advocacy and support to the national government in different platforms and dissemination of learnings through networks.
